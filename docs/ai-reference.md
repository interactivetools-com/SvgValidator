## What SvgValidator Is

SvgValidator checks an uploaded SVG file and answers one question: does it stay inside what
Chrome allows an SVG to do when shown through an `<img>` tag? A file that could run script,
load anything from outside itself, or hang a renderer is **rejected with a list of reasons**.
The file is **never modified**: there is no cleaned output, and the caller stores the original
bytes or refuses the upload.

Every rule is an allowlist, except CSS, which is scanned for a short list of tokens.
Elements, attributes, XML namespaces, URL forms and animation targets not on a list are
rejected. There are no options: every install checks the same way.

```php
use Itools\SvgValidator\SvgValidator;

$result = SvgValidator::checkFile($_FILES['logo']['tmp_name']);
$result->ok;       // true when the file passed
$result->errors;   // Violation[] - empty when ok, otherwise one per distinct problem
```

Requirements: PHP 8.1+, `ext-xmlreader`, `ext-libxml`. No other dependencies.

## API

Three final classes in the `Itools\SvgValidator` namespace. Nothing throws for a bad file:
a hostile or broken upload is expected input and comes back as a rejected `Result`.

```php
SvgValidator::checkFile(string $path): Result     // streams the file; memory does not grow with file size
SvgValidator::checkString(string $svg): Result    // same check on SVG source in a string
SvgValidator::rules(): array                      // the allowlists, for documentation and debugging
```

`checkFile()` and `checkString()` give the same result for the same bytes. `checkFile()` on
a path that is not a readable file returns a result with one `file-unreadable` error; it never
throws. Neither method looks at the file name, extension, or MIME type.

`rules()` returns an array with the keys `elements`, `attributes`, `namespacedAttributes`
(keyed by namespace URI), `inertNamespaces`, `inertProcessingInstructions`, `imageElements`,
and `dataImageTypes`. See [Allowlists](#allowlists). The lists are constants; changing the
returned array changes nothing.

### Result

```php
final class Result
{
    public readonly bool  $ok;       // true when $errors is empty
    public readonly array $errors;   // Violation[], in file order, at most 50
}
```

`errors` holds one `Violation` per distinct problem (deduplicated by code and detail), in the
order found, capped at 50. Prolog problems (`not-svg`, `not-utf8`, `doctype-not-allowed`,
`file-unreadable`) stop the check, so they arrive alone. `malformed-xml`, when present, is
always the last entry: nothing after a parse error is checked.

### Violation

```php
$violation->code;       // 'element-not-allowed' - stable across releases
$violation->detail;     // 'script' - plain text taken from the file, at most 60 characters plus '...'
$violation->template;   // '<%s> is not allowed in uploaded SVGs'
$violation->message;    // '<script> is not allowed in uploaded SVGs'
Violation::TEMPLATES;   // every message template keyed by code, one %s each
```

All four properties are readonly strings.

`detail` and `message` contain text from the uploaded file. HTML-encode them before output.

For translation, `template` goes through the translation function and `detail` goes back in
with `sprintf()`. The template holds literal `<` and `>`, so the whole result is encoded:

```php
echo htmlspecialchars(sprintf(t($violation->template), $violation->detail));
```

`Violation::TEMPLATES` lists every template by code so a translation system can register
them all up front.

## Usage Pattern

```php
use Itools\SvgValidator\SvgValidator;

$upload = $_FILES['logo'];
$result = SvgValidator::checkFile($upload['tmp_name']);

if (!$result->ok) {
    foreach ($result->errors as $violation) {
        echo '<p>', htmlspecialchars($violation->message), '</p>';
    }
    exit;
}
move_uploaded_file($upload['tmp_name'], "/var/www/uploads/logo.svg");   // the original bytes, unchanged
```

SVG sanitizers return a cleaned string to store. SvgValidator does not; store the original.

```php
// WRONG - checkString() returns a Result, not a cleaned SVG
$clean = SvgValidator::checkString($svg);
file_put_contents($path, $clean);

// RIGHT - check, then store the original bytes only when ok
if (SvgValidator::checkString($svg)->ok) {
    file_put_contents($path, $svg);
}
```

Switch on `code`, not on `message`, when the application reacts to a specific rule. Codes
never change once released; message wording can.

## Error Codes

Every code, its template, and what `detail` holds. Templates are `Violation::TEMPLATES`.

| Code                            | Template                                                                                | `detail`                                                                                                                                                        |

Values longer than 60 characters are cut at 60 and end with `...`.

## Rules: Structure

Checked on the first 64 KB before parsing, then by the parser. Each of the first four ends
the check. The first three arrive as the only error; `malformed-xml` ends the list after
anything found earlier in the file.

- **`not-utf8`**: a UTF-16 or UTF-32 byte order mark or null byte at the start, or an XML
  declaration whose `encoding` is anything but `utf-8` (case-insensitive). A UTF-8 byte order
  mark is fine and is skipped.
- **`not-svg`**: after the byte order mark and leading whitespace, the first byte is not `<`.
  An empty or whitespace-only file reports `nothing (the file is empty)`.
- **`doctype-not-allowed`**: a `<!DOCTYPE` with an internal subset (`[`). A DOCTYPE with only
  a public or system id is accepted; nothing is fetched (`LIBXML_NONET`, `LOADDTD` off,
  `SUBST_ENTITIES` off), so an entity that such a DTD would define reports `malformed-xml`
  (`Entity 'foo' not defined`). The five built-in entities and numeric character references
  are fine.
- **`malformed-xml`**: the root tag does not start within 64 KB, or libxml2 reports any
  error or warning. Includes an undefined namespace prefix and invalid UTF-8 bytes. libxml2's
  own limits apply: element depth 256, a single text node 10 MB.
- **`processing-instruction`**: any `<?target ...?>` anywhere, including `<?xml-stylesheet?>`,
  except the targets in `inertProcessingInstructions` (Adobe's `xpacket` XMP markers). The
  `<?xml ...?>` declaration itself is not a processing instruction and is fine.
- **`comment-not-allowed`**: a comment whose content starts with `>` or `->` (written
  `<!-->` or `<!--->`). All other comments are fine.
- **`root-not-svg`**: the root element's local name is not `svg`. Stops the check.
- **`root-namespace-wrong`**: the root `<svg>` is not in `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`. A
  prefixed root (`<svg:svg xmlns:svg="...">`) is fine. Stops the check.

## Rules: Elements and Namespaces

For every element, by its namespace:

- **SVG namespace** (`http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`): the local name must be in the
  [elements allowlist](#allowlists), else `element-not-allowed`. Names are case-sensitive.
  The rejected element's attributes are not checked; its children are.
- **No namespace** (an unbound prefix, or inside `xmlns=""`): `element-not-allowed` with the
  name as written.
- **Inert namespace** (see the list): the element and all its attributes pass without
  inspection, except that an `on*` attribute still rejects.
- **Any other namespace**: `namespace-not-allowed` with the URI. This covers XHTML, MathML,
  XInclude, XML Events, and anything unknown.

Not allowed on purpose, so never add them to a file to "fix" a rejection: `script`,
`foreignObject`, `handler`, `iframe`, `font`, `tref`, `cursor`, `animateColor`, `discard`.
A nested `<svg>` is fine.

## Rules: Attributes

For every attribute on an element in the SVG namespace, in this order:

1. `xmlns` and `xmlns:*` declarations always pass.
2. A name whose local part starts with `on` (case-insensitive, any namespace, any element
   including inert ones) rejects with `event-handler`. No allowed attribute starts with `on`.
3. An attribute in an inert namespace passes.
4. An unprefixed name must be in the [attributes allowlist](#allowlists) or start with
   `data-` or `aria-`. A prefixed name must be one of `xml:lang`, `xml:space`, `xlink:href`,
   `xlink:title`. Anything else rejects with `attribute-not-allowed`. Names are
   case-sensitive.
5. The value is then checked: `href` and `xlink:href` per [URLs](#rules-urls), `style` per
   [CSS](#rules-css), every other value for `url(` per [URLs](#rules-urls), and on animation
   elements per [Animation](#rules-animation).

Not allowed on purpose: `tabindex`, `target`, `crossorigin`, `cursor`, `xml:base`,
`xlink:show`, `xlink:actuate`, every `on*`.

## Rules: URLs

**`href` and `xlink:href`.** The value is trimmed. It must start with `#` (a same-file
reference). On `<image>` and `<feImage>` only, it may instead be an embedded image:
`data:image/png;base64,`, `data:image/jpeg;base64,`, `data:image/jpg;base64,`,
`data:image/gif;base64,`, `data:image/webp;base64,` or `data:image/svg+xml;base64,` followed
by the data (type matched case-insensitively; `;base64,` is required). Anything else rejects:
`image-href-not-allowed` on those two elements, `href-not-allowed` everywhere else, including
`<a href="https://...">` and `href=""`. Nothing checks that the `#id` exists.

**Embedded SVG.** A `data:image/svg+xml;base64,` value is decoded (strict base64) and checked
as its own file with every rule here. Each problem found inside reports as
`embedded-svg-not-allowed` with the inner message as the detail. SVG inside SVG is followed
three levels deep; a fourth level rejects.

**`url()` in attribute values.** Every allowed attribute except `href` and `style` is scanned
for `url(` followed by optional whitespace and an optional quote and then anything but `#`
(case-insensitive). A match rejects with `url-not-fragment` and the attribute name.
`fill="url(#gradient)"` and `fill="url( '#gradient' )"` pass; `fill="url(image.png)"` and
`fill="url(https://...)"` reject. A backslash anywhere in the value rejects first, with
`css-not-allowed` and `\` as the detail: presentation attributes take CSS escapes, so
`fill="u\72l(...)"` is `url(...)` to a browser. `data-*` and `aria-*` values are not CSS and
may contain a backslash.

## Rules: CSS

Applies to the text of every `<style>` element (including CDATA sections and text inside
child elements) and to every `style` attribute. Two regular expressions, case-insensitive:

1. Any of these tokens rejects with `css-not-allowed` and the token as the detail: a
   backslash `\`, `@import`, `@charset`, `image(`, `image-set(`, `src(`, `expression(`,
   `-moz-binding`, `behavior:` (whitespace before the colon allowed).
2. `url(` whose target, after optional whitespace and quote, does not start with `#`,
   `data:font/`, or `data:;base64,` rejects with the `url(` and up to 40 characters after it
   as the detail.
3. More than 1,000,000 bytes of text in one `<style>` element rejects with
   `more than 1,000,000 bytes` as the detail. The text is held whole until the closing tag,
   so the limit keeps memory at 1 MB; the largest `<style>` in the corpus is 64 KB.

So `fill: url(#p)` passes, `@font-face { src: url(data:font/woff2;base64,...) }` passes
anywhere in the CSS, and `background: url(https://...)`, `@import`, and any escape sequence
reject. Comments are not stripped: a banned token inside `/* */` still rejects. Selectors,
properties, `:hover`, `:visited`, `@media`, `@keyframes` and `!important` are not checked.

## Rules: Animation

On `<animate>`, `<set>`, `<animateTransform>` and `<animateMotion>`:

- **`attributeName`** (trimmed, and with any `prefix:` removed, so `xlink:href` and
  `q:href` are both `href`) rejects with `animation-target-not-allowed` when it is `href`,
  `style`, `class`, or starts with `on` (case-insensitive). The detail is the name as written.
- **`from`, `to`, `by`, `values`** reject with `animation-value-not-allowed` when any
  `;`-separated item starts (after whitespace) with a URL scheme, `letter` then letters,
  digits, `+`, `.` or `-`, then `:`, or with `//`, which browsers read as a URL on the
  page's own scheme. Tab, CR and LF inside an item are ignored first, as browsers ignore
  them in a URL, so `java&#x09;script:` is `javascript:`. A literal newline never gets
  that far: XML turns it into a space.
  `values="0;1"` and `to="red"` pass; `to="javascript:x"`, `values="a;https://x"` and
  `by="//x"` reject.

`<mpath>` is allowed; its `href` follows the href rule.

## Rules: Reference Loops and Expansion

After the whole file is read (and only when it parsed cleanly), every same-file reference
that renders its target is followed: `url(#id)` in any attribute including `style`, and
`href` on `<use>`, `<pattern>`, `<linearGradient>`, `<radialGradient>`, `<filter>` and
`<feImage>`. `<a href="#id">` and the animation elements are not followed.

- A loop (`#a` references `#b` which references `#a`, or `#a` references itself) rejects
  with `reference-expansion-too-large` and `form a loop (#a -> #b -> #a)`.
- The elements the references would render are counted. More than 100,000 rejects with
  `expand to more than 100,000 elements`. Ten nested patterns of ten rects each is enough.
- Every `id` is a record, so is every distinct target of an element that renders on its
  own, and each reference is recorded once more per element with an `id` around it; the
  same target inside the same `id` is one record. More than 100,000 records rejects with
  `need more than 100,000 records to track (ids and references)`, so memory stays at a few
  MB whatever the file does.
- Content inside `<defs>`, `<symbol>`, `<pattern>`, `<mask>`, `<marker>`, `<clipPath>` and
  `<filter>` counts only when something references it. A loop inside a `<symbol>` that
  nothing uses is accepted.
- References made through CSS selectors in `<style>` (`.a { fill: url(#p) }`) are not
  followed. This is the known gap in the rule.

## Allowlists

The lists as `rules()` returns them. Anything not here is rejected.

**`elements`** (SVG namespace):

<!-- rules:elements -->

**`attributes`** (unprefixed; plus any `data-*` and `aria-*`):

<!-- /rules:attributes -->

**`namespacedAttributes`**, keyed by namespace URI:

<!-- rules:namespacedAttributes -->
| Namespace                              | Attributes      |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace` | `lang`, `space` |
| `http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink`         | `href`, `title` |
<!-- /rules:namespacedAttributes -->

**`inertNamespaces`**: elements and attributes in these pass without inspection (except
`on*`). Matched by prefix, so every namespace under `http://ns.adobe.com/` or
`http://purl.org/dc/` counts.

<!-- rules:inertNamespaces -->
```text

<!-- /rules:inertNamespaces -->

**`inertProcessingInstructions`**: `<?target ...?>` lines that pass, by target. `xpacket`
is the pair of markers Adobe tools put around their XMP metadata block; nothing reads them.
Every other target rejects with `processing-instruction`.

## How the Rules Compare to Chrome

The yardstick is Chrome's `<img>` mode: the browser parses everything, then disables script,
interaction and every fetch that is not a `data:` URL at render time. The rules are
**stricter** wherever that protection is render-time only and disappears when the file is
opened directly or rasterized on a server:

| Chrome in `<img>`                            | Rule here                             |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `<script>` parsed, never runs                | `element-not-allowed`                 |
| `on*` attributes ignored                     | `event-handler`                       |
| `javascript:` and `https:` hrefs inert       | `href-not-allowed`                    |
| external `url()` silently not loaded         | `url-not-fragment`, `css-not-allowed` |
| `<?xml-stylesheet href="#id"?>` processed    | `processing-instruction`              |
| `<foreignObject>` rendered without script    | `element-not-allowed`                 |
| DTD entities expanded                        | `doctype-not-allowed`                 |
| reference loops broken by the renderer       | `reference-expansion-too-large`       |
| SVG inside `<image>` rendered in secure mode | checked with every rule               |

**Looser than Chrome, or not mirrored:** `:hover`, `:visited`, `:focus` in CSS and
`begin="click"` in SMIL are accepted (Chrome makes them do nothing in `<img>`; opened directly
they work; nothing loads or runs either way). `animateColor` and `discard` are rejected as
unknown elements although Chrome would tolerate them.

## Constraints and Gotchas

- **No cleaned output.** The result is accept or reject. Store the original bytes or refuse.
- **No line numbers.** `Violation` has `code` and `detail` only. The one exception is the
  libxml2 message inside a `malformed-xml` detail, which names a line.
- **Same problem once.** Five `<script>` elements report one error; five different `on*`
  attributes report five.
- **A small malformed file reports only `malformed-xml`.** libxml2 parses in chunks and
  discards the chunk containing the error, so errors in the same chunk are not seen. A large
  file reports the errors found before the broken chunk, then `malformed-xml` last.
- **50 errors and the check stops.** Nothing is read past the fiftieth, including a parse
  error later in the file.
- **`detail` and `message` are unencoded text from the file.** Always valid UTF-8, but they
  can hold `</script>`, quotes and backticks. HTML-encode for a page. A JSON response with
  `Content-Type: application/json` needs nothing extra. Inside a `<script>` block:

  ```php
  $json = json_encode($violation->message, JSON_HEX_TAG | JSON_HEX_AMP | JSON_HEX_APOS | JSON_HEX_QUOT);
  ```
- **Element and attribute names are case-sensitive**; `on*` detection, URL schemes, data
  image types and CSS tokens are case-insensitive.
- **`href` is trimmed before checking**, so `href="  #a"` passes; `href=""` rejects with
  `(empty)`.
- **Not checked:** whether a `#id` target exists, the file extension, the MIME type, file
  size, CSS selectors and properties, and references made through CSS classes.
- **Serving an accepted file:** it is safe to open directly with no special headers.
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` add a second
  layer in case a rule is ever bypassed. Refuse `.svgz` and HTML uploads at the extension
  check; this library does not look at either.
- **Not for inline SVG.** An accepted file is safe to serve as its own document or through
  `<img>`. Pasting SVG source into an HTML page is a different threat model (the page's
  origin, the page's scripts) and is not what these rules were built for.
- **Not configurable.** There is no way to allow an extra element or attribute. Open an issue
  with the file that was rejected.
